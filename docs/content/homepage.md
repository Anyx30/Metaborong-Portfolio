### [HERO — H1 + AEO block + CTAs]

**Eyebrow chip (live availability signal):**
`Accepting new work · Reply in 12h`

**H1 (typewriter, 3 beats — renders as static SSR text, crawlable):**
# Web3 protocols. AI agents. Shipped.

**AEO Extraction Block** *(blockquote — AI engines extract this; doubles as the de-facto subhead, no separate subheading ships)*:
> Metaborong is a Web3 development company and AI agent studio. A remote-first team of senior engineers, globally distributed. We ship DeFi protocols and smart contract audits, AI agents spanning agentic workflows and generative systems, and full-stack SaaS for founders and early-stage startups. Spec to production, fast.

**CTAs:**
- Primary: `Get a scope →`
- Secondary: `Open recent work`

**Right panel (visual — shipped, locked):**
*ASCII-art video loop (`/hero-ascii.mp4`) + 3 glassmorphic pillar-proof overlay cards (AI weights · web3 tx hash · deploy path). IO-gated, reduced-motion safe. Locked per `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-10-section-hero.md`.*

<!-- WHY (A3 copy reconcile, 2026-05-17)
  - Doc was stale vs shipped JSX (old H1, eyebrow, CTAs, plus a subheading + trust line that never shipped). Reconciled doc → shipped reality.
  - H1 kept verbatim per user + keyword research: hub /services/web3/ owns "web3 development company"; homepage hard-targeting it too = cannibalization. H1 stays voice-led; primary keyword recovered in the blockquote's first 6 words + the title tag.
  - Geo unified to remote-first/global (user decision 2026-05-16) — replaces every "US and Europe" mention site-wide (FAQ ×2, llms.txt ×2, schema areaServed → Worldwide).
  - Blockquote sentence 2 was a 29-word 7-item colon dump → first tightened to a parallel 3-pillar clause. Revised 2026-05-17 per user: em-dash removed (writing-guardrails AI tell, blockquote scope only); capability broadened to canonical pillar nouns from services-data.ts ("smart contract audits", "agentic workflows", "generative systems") because the prior "DeFi on Ethereum and Solana / AI agents with RAG" was the narrowest claim on the site; chains intentionally dropped from the hero (also sidesteps the site-wide 3-vs-7 chain inconsistency, deferred). 46 words, in the 40–60 AEO band.
  - Trust line "No pitch decks. No retainers. Direct from founders." dropped — never shipped; read as poetic/unprofessional. Eyebrow carries the trust signal.
-->

**Pre-existing drift noted, not fixed (out of scope):** the AEO checklist below still says "FAQ: 8 Q&As" but the doc body has 7 (post 2026-05-14 cut). Flag only.

### [TRUST BAR]

*Scrolling strip — client/project names as social proof:*

`KGeN · Bionic · DATA3 AI · Defiverse · GET Smart · SEDAX · Bayan · Memestakes Vault`

---

### [SERVICES — H2]

## A small, senior team. Three pillars. End to end.

*Eyebrow:* What we build

*Section intro (synced to live `services.tsx`):*
A boutique studio for founders without a CTO. We ship Web3 protocols, production AI agents, and full SaaS products with one senior team that owns the work from architecture to deployment. Every build is engineered for production, not stopped at a demo.

**Pillar cards (each links to its hub page):**

#### ⬡ Web3 / Blockchain
**Headline:** Decentralised protocol engineering
**Body:** DeFi protocols, NFT marketplaces, wallets, and DAO systems. Smart-contract engineering across EVM, Solana, and Cosmos.
**CTA:** `Web3 services →` → `/services/web3/`

#### ⬡ AI Agents
**Headline:** Production AI agent engineering
**Body:** Agentic pipelines, RAG systems, voice agents, generative AI, and workflow automation. Agents that plan, retrieve, and act inside real software.
**CTA:** `AI agent services →` → `/services/ai-agents/`

#### ⬡ Product Studio
**Headline:** Your full SaaS engineering team
**Body:** SaaS, MVP, and B2B product builds for founders without a CTO. One team owns architecture, engineering, design, and deployment, so the build doesn't fragment across vendors.
**CTA:** `Product Studio services →` → `/services/product-studio/`

---

<!-- BRIEF
  Goal: convince visitor that hiring us is a different shape than hiring an agency.
  Audience state: they've seen our three pillars; now asking "why you over the alternatives".
  One idea: lean senior team that ships faster, pushes back harder, and goes deeper than generalists.
  Proof: portfolio above + founders below.
  CTA: none (objection-handling section, not conversion).
-->

### [WHY METABORONG — H2]

## Why founders choose Metaborong

*Alt headlines:*
- "What you get when you hire us"
- "Three reasons we win the bake-off"

**AEO answer block (38 words — answers "What makes Metaborong different from larger Web3 and AI agencies?"):**
> Founders pick Metaborong over larger Web3 and AI agencies for three reasons: shorter time to a first working version, sharper push-back on the brief, and the specialist depth — multichain protocols and AI agent orchestration — most studios don't have.

**Primary keywords woven in:** `Web3 and AI development` (equal-pillar framing, Tier 2 commercial).
**AEO query owned:** "What makes Metaborong different from larger Web3 and AI agencies?"
**JSON-LD:** Question/Answer pair injected via `whyUsAeoSchema` in `lib/schema.ts` (separate FAQPage from the visible FAQ list, so AI engines can extract this paragraph as a standalone answer).

**Trust strip (between answer block and cards):**
- `4.9 / 5 ★★★★★ on Clutch` (links to Clutch profile)
- `Reply within 12h`
- `4–12 weeks to ship`

All three numbers compound promises made elsewhere on the page (Testimonials → Clutch; Hero eyebrow → 12h; FAQ → 4–12 weeks). No new claims.

**Three feature cards (one outcome per card):**

#### Tag: SPEED
**Headline:** First working version in weeks
**Body:** Lean senior team, no account-manager layer. [AbsolveMe](https://www.absolveme.ai/) needed its launch site live before the liquidity window closed. Site, content, and design support shipped in 2 days. The Solana–NEAR cross-chain layer followed in 5 more.

#### Tag: PRODUCT THINKING
**Headline:** We stress-test the brief before we build
**Body:** Spec gaps get named. Simpler approaches get raised. [SunsetML](https://www.sunsetml.com/) came to us with an AI writing-tool concept. We iterated the architecture with the founder across multiple planning rounds, and stayed on as equity co-founders.

#### Tag: NICHE DEPTH
**Headline:** Multichain Web3 and production-grade AI agents
**Body:** Smart contracts shipped on Ethereum, Solana, Base, Arbitrum, Hyperledger, Polygon, and Avalanche, including [OrbitXPay](https://orbitxpay.com/)'s DeFi-banking module with multi-layer orchestration. AI agent orchestration in production at [SunsetML](https://www.sunsetml.com/) and [PredictRAM](https://predictram.com/).

**Note on Bayan / DATA3:** removed from card 3 per user direction 2026-05-15 — SunsetML carries the AI-agent proof alongside PredictRAM. Bayan and DATA3 remain visible in the Work Preview cards above; only the Why-Us card 3 list was trimmed.

<!-- WHY
  - H3s shifted from theme-shaped ("Niche depth where it counts") to outcome-shaped ("Where most agencies stop, we start") so each card answers a different objection.
  - Killed the tricolon "Direct communication, fast decisions, fewer handoffs" — sounded like every dev-shop site.
  - Each body is 21–32 words, max sentence 16 words.
  - Tag colours in JSX are currently arbitrary — sync phase should unify to brand or drop.
-->


---

<!-- BRIEF
  Goal: prove we ship, with named projects across all three pillars.
  Audience state: convinced of *why*, now asking *what have you actually shipped*.
  One idea: real products across DeFi, AI, gaming, SaaS — not slideware.
  Proof: project names only for now; case studies pending; per-card outcomes deferred per user.
  CTA: "Talk to us →" (top-right of section) + per-card "Read more →" to /#contact placeholder until case studies exist.
-->

### [WORK PREVIEW — H2]

## What we've built

*Alt headlines:*
- "Shipped, in production"
- "Four products, four categories"

*Section intro (28 words):*
Live products across DeFi, AI, gaming, and SaaS — each shipped with founders we still work with. Case studies are on the way.

**Project cards — minimal until case studies land:**

#### KGeN
**Category:** Web3 · Gaming
**One-liner:** *[Deferred — write at case-study time]*
**CTA:** `Read more →` → `/#contact` *(swap to case study URL when published)*

#### Bionic
**Category:** Web3 · DeFi
**One-liner:** *[Deferred]*
**CTA:** `Read more →` → `/#contact`

#### DATA3 AI
**Category:** AI · Data
**One-liner:** *[Deferred]*
**CTA:** `Read more →` → `/#contact`

#### Bayan — AI Calling Chatbot
**Category:** AI · Voice
**One-liner:** *[Deferred]*
**CTA:** `Read more →` → `/#contact`

**Section CTA (top-right):** `Talk to us →` → `/#contact`

<!-- WHY
  - Dropped "Eight products" since the comparison row was softened; consistency matters across page.
  - "Live products" replaces "Eight products" without losing the credibility frame.
  - Per-card one-liners deferred per user direction — placeholder text reads "Deferred — write at case-study time" so JSX sync knows not to render fake outcomes.
  - When case studies exist, replace each "Read more →" target with the real URL in one swap.
-->


---

<!-- BRIEF
  Goal: third-party verification of quality, with an SEO benefit (outbound link to Clutch profile).
  Audience state: seen our pillars + portfolio + why-us, now wants external proof.
  One idea: real clients, verified, rated — read them yourself on Clutch.
  Proof: Clutch reviews (verified, outbound-linked).
  CTA: per-card "Read on Clutch →" + section-level "View all reviews on Clutch →".
-->

### [TESTIMONIALS — H2 → Clutch verified strip + cards]

## Reviewed and verified on Clutch

*Alt headlines:*
- "What clients say after shipping"
- "Verified by clients on Clutch"

**Stat-led header strip (1 row, full-width inside section):**

```
[Clutch logo]    4.9 / 5  ★★★★★    Based on <!-- USER_INPUT: review count --> verified reviews    [Verified ✓]
```

- **Clutch profile URL:** `<!-- USER_INPUT: https://clutch.co/profile/metaborong -->`
- **Aggregate rating:** `<!-- USER_INPUT: confirm 4.9 or actual current score -->`
- **Review count:** `<!-- USER_INPUT: current count -->`

**Three quote cards (each card whole-card links to Clutch — same target as inline CTA):**

#### Quote 1
> "<!-- USER_INPUT: paste top Clutch quote 1 verbatim -->"
**Reviewer:** `<!-- USER_INPUT: Name, Title @ Company -->`
**Rating:** ★★★★★
**CTA:** `Read on Clutch →` → `<!-- USER_INPUT: deep-link to specific review on Clutch -->`

#### Quote 2
> "<!-- USER_INPUT: paste top Clutch quote 2 verbatim -->"
**Reviewer:** `<!-- USER_INPUT: Name, Title @ Company -->`
**Rating:** ★★★★★
**CTA:** `Read on Clutch →` → `<!-- USER_INPUT: deep-link to specific review on Clutch -->`

#### Quote 3
> "<!-- USER_INPUT: paste top Clutch quote 3 verbatim -->"
**Reviewer:** `<!-- USER_INPUT: Name, Title @ Company -->`
**Rating:** ★★★★★
**CTA:** `Read on Clutch →` → `<!-- USER_INPUT: deep-link to specific review on Clutch -->`

**Section CTA (below grid):** `View all reviews on Clutch →` → `<!-- USER_INPUT: Clutch profile URL -->`

<!-- WHY
  - "Voices of trust" was the worst agency-speak on the page — replaced with a verb-led headline that names the source ("Clutch").
  - Verbatim quotes from existing site (Siddharth, Dr. Josh, Abhishek, Girish) are NOT carried over — user picks 3 from Clutch instead. The two anonymous "Client" attributions die here.
  - Outbound links to Clutch give the section measurable SEO value (Clutch profile traffic = reciprocal trust signal) and let visitors verify independently.
  - All link attributes on the JSX should be: rel="noopener" target="_blank" — Clutch is a third-party domain.
  - Quote selection rule: pick the 3 with most specific outcome language; avoid generic "highly recommend" if better exists.
-->


---

<!-- BRIEF
  Goal: E-E-A-T anchor. Show the work is done by named, reachable, technical co-founders.
  Audience state: convinced of pillars + portfolio + reviews; now asking "who actually builds this".
  One idea: three founders, hands-on, named on every project — not a sales layer.
  Proof: LinkedIn URLs + per-founder specifics (USER_INPUT needed).
  CTA: per-card LinkedIn link.
-->

### [FOUNDERS — H2]

## The team behind the work

*Alt headlines:*
- "Three founders. No account managers."
- "Who you'll actually work with"

*Section intro (33 words — tightened from 52):*
Three founders, hands-on in every engagement. The portfolio above was built by us — not by a contracting layer we manage. You'll be in Slack with the people writing your code.

**Founder cards:**

#### Arnab Ray
**Role:** CEO & Co-Founder
**Bio:** Runs strategy and go-to-market for the studio. <!-- USER_INPUT: one specific past project or Web3-ecosystem credential Arnab personally led (e.g. "Helped scale [Project X] to [outcome]" — 12–14 words). -->
**Link:** `LinkedIn →` → `https://linkedin.com/in/arnab-ray`

#### Anik Ghosh
**Role:** COO & Co-Founder
**Bio:** Owns project delivery. Every engagement ships on schedule because Anik says no when it can't. <!-- USER_INPUT: one specific operational signal — e.g. background, prior company, or a delivery-record line (12–14 words). -->
**Link:** `LinkedIn →` → `https://linkedin.com/in/anik-ghosh`

#### Soumojit Ash
**Role:** CTO & Co-Founder
**Bio:** Designs the architecture under every protocol and AI system we ship. <!-- USER_INPUT: chains or frameworks Soumojit has shipped on — e.g. "Smart contracts on Ethereum, Solana, Base; multi-agent orchestration with LangChain" (12–16 words). -->
**Link:** `LinkedIn →` → `https://linkedin.com/in/soumojit-ash`

<!-- WHY
  - Killed "Leads strategy, client relationships, and business direction" — the most agency-template line on the page.
  - Each bio now has a [role verb] + [specific proof] structure. The proof is a USER_INPUT placeholder because fabricated specifics damage E-E-A-T more than they help.
  - Lede dropped from 52 → 33 words. "You'll be in Slack" is concrete; "active in every engagement" was abstract.
  - LinkedIn URLs preserved from current JSX.
-->

### [PROBLEM → SOLUTION — H2]

## Building in Web3 and AI is still too hard

*Pain section — no product mention:*
Most founders approaching Web3 or AI development face the same problems. Either they hire a large agency that treats the project like a ticket in a queue, or they try to assemble a freelance team that lacks the architectural depth to build what actually needs to exist. The result is slow timelines, accumulated technical debt, and products that launch but do not scale.

The Web3 and AI landscape moves faster than traditional development cycles allow. DeFi protocols change. Agentic AI frameworks are still maturing. A team that was building Web2 products last year is not the right fit for a protocol that will handle real user funds.

*Solution introduction:*
Metaborong was built specifically for this problem. A small, senior team with deep experience in DeFi protocol architecture, AI agent orchestration, and full-stack product development — working directly with founders from the first conversation to the final deployment.

<!-- [HOW IT WORKS] section removed 2026-05-14: no equivalent exists on live site. If restored, source-of-truth here goes first. -->

---

<!-- BRIEF
  Goal: objection handling — surface the trade-off honestly so the visitor self-qualifies.
  Audience state: deciding between us, a larger agency, or a freelance team.
  One idea: each option wins on something; here's the honest read.
  Proof: chain names + acknowledged competitor wins (the ✓ marks).
  CTA: none (decision-support section).
-->

### [COMPARISON — H2]

## How Metaborong compares

*Alt headlines:*
- "Choosing between us and the alternatives"
- "Where each option wins"

*Section intro (16 words):*
If you're choosing between us, a large agency, or a freelance team — here's the honest read.

| | Metaborong | Large Web3 or AI Agency | Freelance team |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Team access** | Direct — founders | Account manager layer | Direct but inconsistent |
| **AI-native services** | Core offering | Add-on or absent | Rare |
| **DeFi depth** | 7 chains — Ethereum, Solana, Base, Arbitrum, Hyperledger, Polygon, Avalanche | Generic | Depends on individual |
| **Speed to delivery** | Weeks | Months | Unpredictable |
| **Product thinking** | Built in | Execution-focused | Absent |
| **Track record** | DeFi · AI · SaaS shipped | Hundreds of clients ✓ | Case by case |

*Footnote:*
✓ marks where the alternative genuinely wins. Larger agencies have longer track records — a real advantage for enterprises needing procurement comfort. We win on speed, AI-native depth, and direct access.

<!-- WHY
  - "8 shipped products" softened to "DeFi · AI · SaaS shipped" per user direction ("not needed" on the count).
  - "Deep, multichain" replaced with named chains — concrete claim, easier to verify, better AEO.
  - Removed "Communication" row (collapsed into "Team access"); kept the section tight at 6 rows.
  - Removed "Where they win" row — duplicated the footnote and felt list-stuffed.
  - Intro sentence (16 words) sets a framing before the table to reduce cognitive load.
-->


---

<!-- BRIEF
  Goal: handle the last objections before Contact CTA + give AI engines clean extractable answers.
  Audience state: warmed; objections remaining are timeline, cost shape, location, scope-fit.
  One idea per Q: one self-contained answer that doesn't repeat the rest of the page.
  Proof: concrete ranges where honest (4–12 weeks, remote-first/global).
  CTA: none — funnels into Contact CTA below.

  Cut 2 entries per user decision (2026-05-14): old Q2 (Web3 service list) + Q3 (AI service list) — both duplicated Services section.
  Added 1 new high-friction Q ("Do we need an NDA…") to mirror the hero "no pitch decks" promise.
  Result: 7 entries (was 8), no repetition of "Metaborong is…" as sentence-start.
-->

### [FAQ — H2]

## Frequently asked questions

*Alt headlines:*
- "Questions before we start"
- "What founders ask before scoping"

*Each answer ≤50 words, self-contained for AI extraction, varied sentence subjects.*

**Q: What is Metaborong?**
A: A Web3 and AI development studio run by three technical co-founders. We build DeFi protocols, autonomous AI systems, and custom SaaS products for founders and crypto-native teams. The team is remote-first and globally distributed.

**Q: How long does a typical project take?**
A: Four to twelve weeks depending on scope. Smart contract audits, AI integrations, and scoped agent builds usually deliver in four to six. DeFi protocols and full SaaS platforms take longer.

**Q: Who do you work with?**
A: Early-stage founders and startup teams building Web3 or AI products, mostly. Also crypto-native projects needing specialist capacity, and enterprises integrating blockchain or AI into existing systems.

**Q: Do we need an NDA before talking?**
A: No. The first call is just to understand what you're building and whether we're the right fit. NDAs come when scoping gets concrete — not before a 30-minute conversation.

**Q: How are you different from larger Web3 and AI agencies?**
A: Smaller, senior, faster. Founders communicate directly with the engineers writing code. Web3 and AI sit as equal pillars — neither is bolted onto the other — and every engagement is run with co-builder accountability, not contractor execution.

**Q: Where are you based?**
A: Remote-first and globally distributed, with no single head office. The founding team is reachable at contact@metaborong.com for any first conversation.

**Q: Do you work outside Web3 and AI?**
A: Yes. The Product Studio pillar builds custom Web2 SaaS platforms independently of blockchain or AI. Teams who need a full-stack partner for a pure SaaS build can engage through that track.

<!-- WHY
  - Old Q2 + Q3 cut per user — they duplicated Services section verbatim. Service lists belong on hub pages.
  - New "Do we need an NDA" Q earns its place — it's high-friction, it differentiates from larger agencies, and it mirrors the hero's "no pitch decks" promise.
  - Sentence-start variety: only 1 of 7 answers now starts with "A: A Web3…" subject. The 8/8 "Metaborong is…" pattern is gone.
  - Each answer is 16–35 words. All under 50.

<!-- BRIEF
  Goal: convert. Get the visitor to email.
  Audience state: warm, objections handled, ready to either email or bounce.
  One idea: send us your spec, get a written approach back — no gatekeeping.
  Proof: 12h reply time (mirrors hero eyebrow).
  CTA: "Email us" (3 words, ≤ DESIGN.md cap).
-->

### [CONTACT CTA — dark section]

## Tell us the build. We'll send the approach.

*Alt headlines:*
- "Skip the pitch deck. Start the build."
- "Send us your spec — get an approach back in 48 hours."

**Sub (18 words):**
No pitch deck. No discovery-call gauntlet. Just a written approach you can take or leave.

**Primary CTA:** `Email us →` → `mailto:contact@metaborong.com?subject=New%20project%20inquiry`

**Risk reducer (below CTA, small grey type):**
Most teams hear back within 12 hours.

**Secondary (small, plain):** `contact@metaborong.com`

<!-- WHY
  - "Got a project in mind?" was generic — every dev shop uses it. New headline is action-shaped and outcome-promising ("send" + "approach").
  - Mirrors hero "Reply in 12h" eyebrow so the risk reducer feels like a kept promise, not a new claim.
  - Sub copy kept the working "no pitch deck / no fluff" anti-process framing but reshaped from tricolon to two short sentences for breathing room.
  - CTA stayed "Email us" (3 words — at the DESIGN.md cap). Avoided "Start a conversation →" (4 words, soft).
