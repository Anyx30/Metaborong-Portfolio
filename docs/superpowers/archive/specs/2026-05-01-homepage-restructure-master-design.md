# Homepage Restructure — Master Plan

## Context

The homepage renders all 12 sections (nav + 10 sections + footer) but visual quality is "broken" because every section uses inline `style={{}}` and reimplements its own padding, card shape, and type scale. The `@theme` tokens in `app/globals.css` are defined but unused. A previous "premium iteration" spec was attempted and retired (commit `3611209`) because it specified visual changes without fixing the underlying inconsistency-vector.

**This plan does two things:**
1. Locks a small set of design primitives that enforce consistency by construction.
2. Defines the section narrative arc + per-section responsibilities, so each future session refactors one section against the primitives without needing to rediscover the system.

**Inspiration reference:** supermemory.ai — used for the *consistency posture* (one card system, one rhythm, restrained motion), not the palette. Metaborong keeps blue `#204AF8` + orange `#F6851B` + a third color for AI Agents.

**Narrative arc (locked):** Hero → Trust bar → Problem → Services → Why Us → Work → Comparison → Testimonials → Founders → FAQ → Contact CTA → Footer. Reorders current page to "problem-led narrative" so each section has a clear job.

## Concrete inconsistencies the plan fixes

| Drift | Where | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Inline styles only; tokens unused | All 13 components | All sections move to Tailwind classes referencing `@theme` tokens |
| Stray emerald `#10b981` | nav, services, why-us, work-preview | Add `--color-ai: #10b981` token; replace literals with `text-ai`, `bg-ai`, etc. |
| Two H2 scales | services/why-us vs others | One display H2: `clamp(32px, 4vw, 52px)`, weight 700, tracking `-0.035em` |
| Card padding drift (`44/36`, `36/32`, `32/28`, `32`) | services, why-us, work, founders, testimonials | One `<Card>` primitive: `p-9` (36px) on default, `p-10` (40px) on featured |
| Card radius drift (4/8/12/16/20) | hero eyebrow, work thumbs, cards, services wrapper | Two radii only: `rounded-md` (8px) for chips/thumbs, `rounded-lg` (12px) for cards |
| Header→content margin drift (16/48/56) | every section | One value: 48px (`mb-12`) below `<SectionHeader>` |
| Hero padding deviates (`96 64 96 80` vs `96 80`) | hero only | Hero keeps its own `max-w-[1600px]` outer (orb needs spatial room — see Session 2 notes); left-column applies the locked horizontal scale internally |
| Eyebrow size drift (11 vs 12) | hero vs others | One eyebrow: 11px, 700 weight, `0.1em` tracking, uppercase, `text-gray-light` |

## Design System (the primitives)

### Tokens

**Add to `app/globals.css` `@theme`:**
```
--color-ai: #10b981;           /* third pillar */
--color-border: #e5e7eb;
--color-border-subtle: #f3f4f6;
```

The existing tokens (`--color-brand`, `--color-accent`, `--color-dark`, `--color-gray`, `--color-gray-light`, `--color-bg`, `--color-bg-subtle`, `--color-canvas`, spacing 1–10, radii sm/md/lg/xl) stay as-is.

### Type scale (locked)

| Role | Size | Weight | Tracking | Line | Color |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Display H1 (hero) | `clamp(36px, 4.5vw, 64px)` | 700 | `-0.04em` | 1.02 | `text-dark` (brand accent on highlighted span) |
| Display H2 (section) | `clamp(32px, 4vw, 52px)` | 700 | `-0.035em` | 1.05 | `text-dark` |
| H3 (card title) | 20px | 700 | `-0.025em` | 1.2 | `text-dark` |
| Body lead (intro) | 16px | 400 | `-0.01em` | 1.65 | `text-gray` |
| Body | 14px | 400 | `-0.005em` | 1.75 | `text-gray` |
| Eyebrow | 11px | 700 | `0.1em` uppercase | 1 | `text-gray-light` |
| Micro | 12px | 400 | `-0.01em` | 1.4 | `text-gray-light` |

### Spacing rhythm (locked)

The locked **values** (not class names) are authoritative. The project's `@theme` defines a custom `--spacing-N` scale (slot 9 = 96px, slot 7 = 48px, etc.) that does not align with Tailwind's default `p-N`/`py-N`/`mb-N` numeric mapping. To keep the rhythm unambiguous, primitives use **arbitrary value classes** (`py-[96px]`, `mb-[48px]`, `p-[36px]`) rather than scale-dependent shorthand. Section refactors should follow the same convention.

- Section vertical padding: 96px → `py-[96px]`.
- Horizontal padding scale (apply to **nav, sections, footer** uniformly): `px-[24px] md:px-[48px] lg:px-[96px] xl:px-[128px]` — 24px mobile, 48px tablet (≥768), 96px desktop (≥1024), 128px large desktop (≥1280). Gives the premium breathing room on standard monitors and avoids the prior 80px-only step that felt tight at 1440px+.
- Section content max-width: **1120px wide; 880px narrow (comparison, founders intro); 720px prose (problem, FAQ).** *(Amended 2026-05-03 — Session 5. Tightened from 1280/960/760 to give the page an editorial, founder-direct register matching the brand voice. Linear/Mercury/Stripe/Anthropic-careers width band. Hero outer cap stays 1600 — the orb needs spatial room and the copy column at ~960px effective stays coherent with the new wide cap.)*
- Nav stays full-bleed (no `max-w`) — chrome layer hugs viewport edges. Sections cap content at the `max-width` above. The two intentionally don't align on wide monitors; this matches Linear/Vercel/Stripe convention.
- `<SectionHeader>` → content: 48px → `mb-[48px]`.
- Card grid gap: 24px → `gap-6` (this one is unambiguous since 24px is also default `gap-6`).
- Card internal vertical rhythm: eyebrow 18px → title → 14px → body → 28px → CTA.

### Card system (one primitive, three variants)

```
<Card variant="default" | "featured" | "quote">
```
- All variants: `bg-white` (or `bg-bg-subtle` on dark-section variant), `border border-border`, `rounded-lg` (= 12px, existing `--radius-lg` token; the spec's earlier `rounded-xl` was a typo — `--radius-xl` is 20px), hover lift `-translate-y-0.5` + `border-brand/30` (200ms).
- `default`: 36px padding → `p-[36px]`. Used by why-us, work-preview, founders.
- `featured`: 40px padding → `p-[40px]`, 3px accent left-border in pillar color (passed via `accentColor` prop). Used by services pillars.
- `quote`: 32px padding → `p-[32px]`, italic body. Used by testimonials.

No "bordered grid" trick like the current services section — that's a 1px-gap hack and reads inconsistent. Replace with normal grid + uniform cards.

### Motion grammar

*Implemented 2026-05-04 in Session 5.5 — see `<Reveal>` primitive at `components/ui/reveal.tsx` and Session 5.5 entry below.*

- One enter animation: `opacity 0 → 1`, `translateY(8px) → 0`, 400ms cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1), triggered on intersection (50px before viewport). Respects `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` (skipped entirely).
- Card hover: 200ms.
- No parallax. No big reveals. The orb keeps its existing animation.

### Primitives to build

1. `components/ui/section.tsx` — `<Section bg="default" | "subtle" | "dark" maxWidth="wide" | "narrow" | "prose">`. Internally wraps children in `<Reveal>` so all sections inherit the enter animation for free.
2. `components/ui/section-header.tsx` — eyebrow + h2 + optional intro, fixed bottom margin
3. `components/ui/card.tsx` — variants above
4. `components/ui/eyebrow.tsx` — extracted because it appears 11× (and currently drifts)
5. `components/ui/reveal.tsx` *(added 2026-05-04, Session 5.5)* — client component that fires once on intersection, animates `opacity 0→1` + `translateY 8→0` over 400ms, respects `prefers-reduced-motion`

Existing `Button`, `Logo`, `Badge` stay.

## Visual temperament (locked 2026-05-04, calibrated against shipped Problem signature)

The master plan locks the **mechanics** (tokens, type scale, spacing rhythm, card system, section bg weave). It also locks a **temperament** for how the page should feel as a whole. The temperament was added 2026-05-04 after Section 4 (Problem) shipped its signature — Problem is the first calibration data point.

**Chrome (top of page) — restraint.**
Hero, Nav, Trust bar are locked at currently-shipped state. No numbered eyebrows, no terminal/IDE chrome retrofits, no D-trimmed engineering chassis (both directions explored and rejected during the 2026-05-04 brainstorming session — see `memory/visual-direction-and-workflow.md` for the rejection rationale and exploration artifacts). The Hero orb carries the maximalist character; everything in the chrome layer (Nav + Trust bar) defers to it.

**Body sections (4–13) — signature personality + supporting motion, one per section.**
Each body section earns one signature visual moment that is disciplined, ownable, and proprietary. The signature lives in a typographic, layout, or interaction state at rest; motion stages how that state arrives. Motion is *complementary*, not the headline.

The shipped Problem signature is the calibration example:
- **At rest:** the bridge phrase `treats the project like a ticket in a queue` carries a typographic stamp — 1px brand-blue hairline underline, baseline-flush, plus weight delta + color delta. A reader scanning the section instantly sees which line is load-bearing.
- **In motion:** scroll triggers the section's existing global `<Reveal>` (whole-section fade+rise, 400ms). ~600ms later the stamp's weight, color, and underline animate in over 350ms / 350ms / 500ms (split timing — the underline lands last as punctuation). The motion is subtle, not the spectacle; the typographic state is the signature.
- **Reduced motion:** the final state renders on mount. The signature is preserved without the staging.

Other body sections will land different signatures (Services: pillar visualizer; Work: hover-reveal cards; Comparison: animated table reveal; FAQ: accordion motion; etc. — exact moves decided per-section). They share Problem's posture: at-rest typographic/visual state is the signature, motion supports it, motion respects `prefers-reduced-motion`.

**What this rules out (do not re-propose):**
- Page-wide motion grammar beyond the existing global `<Reveal>` plus per-section signature layers. No parallax. No big reveals. No "the whole page has rhythm X."
- Internal stagger on rule/eyebrow/H2/body within a section (rejected during Problem brainstorming as A2). Sections enter as one block; signature animates on top.
- Diagrammatic/schematic gestures inside a 720px prose column (Problem's lane B/C — explicitly rejected at signature scale below the 880/1120 cap).
- Chrome retrofits to Hero, Nav, or Trust bar.

**Multi-skill workflow drives implementation (locked).**
Per `memory/visual-direction-and-workflow.md`: each section runs `superpowers:brainstorming` → `superpowers:writing-plans` → `/design-shotgun` → `/plan-design-review` → implementation (`/frontend-design` + `/frontend-patterns`; `/landing-page-generator` only for genuinely net-new copy + structure, which Problem qualified for and most subsequent sections will not). One section per session.

**Note for `/design-shotgun`:** the AI image generator is the right tool for full-section composition exploration (Services, Work, Founders, Comparison) where layout and visual direction are the question. For sub-pixel typographic decisions (Problem-style finishes), prefer the visual-companion HTML/CSS path — AI raster generation can't reliably distinguish 1px line weights, baseline offsets, or font-weight deltas. Problem ran the visual-companion path and saved the V1 finish to `~/.gstack/projects/Anyx30-Metaborong-Portfolio/designs/section-problem-stamp-20260504/approved.json` with full taste-profile signal.

## Section inventory

Each section's master responsibility, layout, and what it inherits. Per-session work writes a small section-level spec inheriting these.

### 1. Nav (`components/layout/nav.tsx`) — done in Session 2
- Sticky frosted-glass, 56px tall, **full-bleed** (no `max-w`). Padding follows the global horizontal scale.
- All inline styles migrated to Tailwind; no hex literals; dropdown card mirrors `<Card>` border + radius.
- Flair: nav-link underline indicator, dropdown enter animation + caret, magnetic CTA hover (scale + glow).

### 2. Hero (`components/sections/hero.tsx`) — done in Session 3
- 60/40 grid (`lg:grid-cols-[60fr_40fr]`), light bg `bg-bg-subtle`, min-h-screen.
- **Hero does NOT use `<Section>` primitive** — keeps its own `max-w-[1600px]` outer wrapper (orb needs the spatial room; copy column at ~960px effective stays coherent with the new wide cap). Left column applies the locked horizontal scale internally (`px-[24px] md:px-[48px] lg:px-[96px] xl:px-[128px]`); eyebrow uses `<Eyebrow>`; H1 uses display-H1 scale unchanged; AEO blockquote keeps brand-blue left border but uses tokens.
- Left column wrapped in `<Reveal>` for the global enter animation (Session 5.5).
- Right column hosts existing Three.js orb — untouched, has its own motion.

### 3. Trust bar (`components/sections/trust-bar.tsx`) — done in Session 4
- Thin full-bleed band between sections. Marquee logo wall — no text caption. Per-logo silhouette / grayscale / reveal treatment encoded in the client list (`keepSilhouette` / `softMute` flags) so each asset reads correctly on the white background and lights up its real brand color on hover/focus. Marquee animation continues.
- Wrapped in `<Reveal>` (Session 5.5).

### 4. Problem (`components/sections/problem.tsx`) — done in Session 5; signature added Session 6 (2026-05-04)
- Pulls from `docs/content/homepage.md:223-231`, **compressed 2026-05-04** to one pain paragraph (bridge + second pain paragraph dropped — see Session 5 spec for rationale).
- Layout: prose column (`<Section maxWidth="prose">` = 720px, centered) with **left-aligned** editorial typography (eyebrow, H2, body). 40×2px brand-blue accent rule above the eyebrow.
- **Signature moment (Session 6, 2026-05-04):** the bridge phrase `treats the project like a ticket in a queue` is wrapped in a small client component `PhraseStamp` (`components/sections/phrase-stamp.tsx`) that owns its own `IntersectionObserver`. ~600ms after the section enters viewport, the phrase animates: color shifts gray→dark (350ms), weight 400→500 (350ms), brand-blue 1px hairline underline draws L→R (500ms, lands last as typographic punctuation). `box-decoration-clone` ensures the underline survives multi-line wrap on mobile. Non-interactive (no hover, no focus). Respects `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` (renders final state on mount). See spec `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-04-section-problem-signature.md` and plan `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-04-section-problem-signature.md`.
- Section gets `id="problem"` for in-page anchoring + future schema work.
- Background: `bg-bg` (white).
- Bridge into Services dropped — Services Session 6 must rewrite its intro to absorb that role.

### 5. Services (`components/sections/services.tsx`)
- 3-column pillar grid. Replace 1px-gap-bordered hack with normal `gap-6` grid + `<Card variant="featured">`.
- Each pillar card has: pillar tag (eyebrow in pillar color), headline (H3), body, CTA link.
- Background alternates: `bg-bg-subtle`.
- **Intro copy must absorb the bridge function dropped from Problem (Session 5, 2026-05-04).** Current intro is generic ("operates across three interconnected service pillars..."). Rewrite to do the bridge job: introduce Metaborong as the *third option* to the agency-vs-freelance trap named in Problem. Suggested direction: lead with "A small, senior team. Three pillars. End to end." or similar — confident, declarative, and clearly positioned as the answer to Problem's setup. Locked phrasing TBD in Session 6 spec.

### 6. Why Us (`components/sections/why-us.tsx`)
- 3 default cards. Already close to right; just migrate to `<Card variant="default">` and `<SectionHeader>`.
- Background: `bg-white`.

### 7. Work Preview (`components/sections/work-preview.tsx`)
- **3 cards on desktop** (amended 2026-05-03 from 4-up — at the new 1120 wide cap, 4-up cards become too tight; 3-up plus a "View all work →" link reads as more premium and matches Vercel/Linear case-study layouts); 2 on tablet; 1 on mobile.
- Replace flat colored thumbnail with `aspect-[4/3]` placeholder using `bg-bg-subtle` + dotted brand-tinted overlay (until real case-study assets land).
- Section header has trailing "View All Work →" link aligned right (already correct).
- Background: `bg-bg-subtle`.

### 8. Comparison (`components/sections/comparison.tsx`)
- Narrow column (`<Section maxWidth="narrow">` = 880px), table with token-driven borders.
- Highlight Metaborong column with `bg-bg-subtle` + brand-colored top accent.
- Footnote in micro style.
- Background: `bg-white`.

### 9. Testimonials (`components/sections/testimonials.tsx`)
- 2-column on desktop, 1-column mobile. `<Card variant="quote">`.
- Avatar = initials in token-colored circle (replace inline brand bg with `bg-brand`).
- Background: `bg-bg-subtle`.

### 10. Founders (`components/sections/founders.tsx`)
- Section header + intro paragraph + 3 cards. Fix: `mb-16` after intro is currently `mb-48`-ish drift.
- Founder LinkedIn URL placeholders — flag for user to replace.
- Background: `bg-white`.

### 11. FAQ (`components/sections/faq.tsx`)
- Prose column (`<Section maxWidth="prose">` = 720px), accordion with token-driven borders.
- Already close to right; just migrate styles + use `<SectionHeader>`.
- Background: `bg-bg-subtle`.

### 12. Contact CTA (`components/sections/contact-cta.tsx`)
- `bg-canvas` (dark), centered, max-w-[600px].
- Currently uses inline style for the brand button — switch to `<Button>`.

### 13. Footer (`components/layout/footer.tsx`)
- `bg-canvas`, padding aligned with sections (`py-9 px-20`).
- Migrate styles. No structural change.

## Execution model

The user runs **one section per session.** Each session:
1. Reads this master plan.
2. Writes a small section-level spec at `docs/superpowers/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-section-<name>.md` (inherits the system, only documents section-specific decisions).
3. Writes a small section-level plan at `docs/superpowers/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-section-<name>.md`.
4. Implements the section using **`/frontend-design:frontend-design`** for visual decisions and **`/frontend-patterns`** for React structure. **`/landing-page-generator`** is reserved for any net-new section (Problem) where copy + structure are generated together.
5. Single self-review pass at end.

**Subagents:** Not needed. Each section is small, isolated, and sequential. Subagent dispatch would only add coordination cost.

**Session 1 (DONE — 2026-05-01):** Built the four primitives (`<Section>`, `<SectionHeader>`, `<Card>`, `<Eyebrow>`) at `components/ui/` and added `--color-ai`, `--color-border`, `--color-border-subtle` tokens to `app/globals.css`. Build passes; no visual change yet. Two clarifications were folded back into this spec: (a) cards use `rounded-lg` not `rounded-xl`, (b) primitives use arbitrary-value classes (`py-[96px]` etc.) instead of scale shorthand to bypass the `--spacing-N` ↔ default-Tailwind ambiguity.

**Session 2 (DONE — 2026-05-02):** Refactored `components/layout/nav.tsx` — all inline styles migrated to Tailwind, `#10b981` literals replaced with `text-ai`/`bg-ai`, dropdown restyled to match `<Card>` border/radius, mobile hamburger fixed. Three flair additions per user request: (a) 2px brand-blue underline on nav links via `after:` pseudo-elements, also lit on Services trigger when dropdown is open, (b) dropdown enter animation (`navDropdownIn` keyframe in `globals.css`, 150ms fade+rise) plus an upward caret notch above the card aligned to the trigger, (c) magnetic CTA — wrapper around `<Button>` does `hover:scale-[1.02]` + brand-tinted `box-shadow` glow.

Two structural deviations from the original plan, both driven by user feedback on a wide monitor:
1. **Nav is full-bleed** (no `max-w`) instead of `max-w-[1280px]`. The 1280 cap pulled the CTA toward the middle of wide monitors. Spec section "Spacing rhythm" updated accordingly.
2. **Horizontal padding scale widened** from `px-6 md:px-[80px]` to the 4-step `px-[24px] md:px-[48px] lg:px-[96px] xl:px-[128px]`. Spec section "Spacing rhythm" updated accordingly. **Future section refactors must adopt this scale**, not the original 80px-only value.

**Critical bug fix in `app/globals.css`:** The universal reset `*, *::before, *::after { margin: 0; padding: 0 }` was unlayered, which silently outranks every Tailwind v4 `@layer utilities` rule. Result: `p-*`, `m-*`, `gap-*` — including arbitrary-value forms like `p-[8px]` — were rendering as `0` everywhere. Wrapped the reset in `@layer base` to restore proper precedence. This affected Session 1's primitives too (they were importing fine but their `p-[36px]` etc. were no-ops). All future sessions can now rely on Tailwind utilities working as expected.

**Session 5.5 (NEW — added 2026-05-04 from /plan-design-review on Problem):** Build the global enter animation promised in the master plan motion grammar (`opacity 0→1, translateY 8px→0, 400ms cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)`, triggered on intersection 50px before viewport). The motion grammar has been spec'd since Session 1 but never implemented; three shipped sections (Hero, Trust bar, Problem) currently render static on scroll. Implementation: small client component `<Reveal>` using `IntersectionObserver` (one observer instance, unobserve on first intersection). Must respect `prefers-reduced-motion` (skip the transform + duration → 0). Apply to Hero copy column, Trust bar marquee container, Problem section content, and bake into `<Section>` primitive so all future sections inherit it for free. Verify in agent-browser at `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`. Defer to Session 5.5 — do NOT bundle into a content session.

**Session 6 (DONE — 2026-05-04):** Problem section signature moment shipped. Net-new client component `components/sections/phrase-stamp.tsx` (~58 lines) wraps the bridge phrase. Owns its own `IntersectionObserver`, applies `box-decoration-clone` for multi-line wrap, ships split motion timing (350ms color/weight + 500ms underline draw) as default. Non-interactive. `prefers-reduced-motion` renders final state on mount. First section to land a body-section signature; calibrates the "Visual temperament" section above. Spec at `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-04-section-problem-signature.md`, plan at `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-04-section-problem-signature.md`. V1 finish (1px brand-blue baseline-flush hairline + weight 400→500 + color gray→dark) chosen from 6 candidates via visual-companion HTML/CSS rendering — AI image generation skipped because sub-pixel typography needs real-CSS fidelity.

**Session 3 onward:** Hero → Trust bar → Problem (new) → **Session 5.5 global motion** → **Session 6 Problem signature** → Services → Why Us → Work → Comparison → Testimonials → Founders → FAQ → Contact CTA → Footer. Stop after each.

## Critical files

**To create:**
- `components/ui/section.tsx`
- `components/ui/section-header.tsx`
- `components/ui/card.tsx`
- `components/ui/eyebrow.tsx`
- `components/ui/reveal.tsx` *(added Session 5.5, 2026-05-04)*
- `components/sections/problem.tsx` (Session 4 or 5)

**To modify (one per session):**
- `app/globals.css` (Session 1 — token additions)
- `app/page.tsx` (Session 1 — re-order to new arc, add Problem import)
- All 13 section/layout files (one per session)

---

## Verification (per session)

After each section:
- `pnpm dev` → visit `http://localhost:3000` → section renders with no console errors.
- Visual check: card padding, radius, eyebrow, H2 size, header→content margin all match the locked values.
- Scan the section file for any remaining hardcoded hex (`#`) that isn't a brand pillar color used intentionally — if found, replace with token.
- No inline `style={{}}` in the refactored file (except where dynamic computation requires it, e.g., the orb HUD).

After Session 1 (primitives only):
- Primitives type-check and import without breaking the build.
- No visual change yet — page still renders identically.

---

## Out of scope (deferred)

- Content rewrite (sequential, after design pass — using existing `homepage.md` baseline)
- Service hub pages, individual service pages, About, Contact, Blog
- Case study content (blocked on client details)
- `llms.txt`, `sitemap.ts`, `robots.ts`, FAQPage schema
- Mobile responsiveness pass beyond what each section's primitives give for free
- Core Web Vitals audit
- LinkedIn URLs for founders (placeholder still)
